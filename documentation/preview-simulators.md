# Using the Preview Simulators for the Quantum Development Kit

As a preview feature, the Quantum Development Kit provides capabilities for noisy and stabilizer simulation. This feature allows for simulating the behavior of Q# programs under the influence of noise, and for using the stabilizer representation (a.k.a. CHP simulation) with programs that only call Clifford operations.

> For more information about the development of this feature, please see the GitHub issue at <https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/issues/714>.

Currently, the preview simulators are supported for use with:

- C# host programs
- Python host programs
- Q# standalone notebooks

The preview simulators are not yet supported by:

- Q# standalone command-line programs
- QIR-based executables

## Known issues and limitations

As this feature is currently under active development, there are still a number of limitations and missing capabilities.

- Continuous-time rotations (e.g.: `Rx`, `Ry`, `Rz`, and `Exp`) are not yet supported.
- Fractional rotations (e.g.: `R1Frac`, `ExpFrac`) are not yet supported.
- The `Controlled Y` operation with more than one control qubit is not yet supported.
- The `Controlled T` operation is not yet supported.
- Joint measurement is not yet supported.
- In some cases, qubits may need to be manually `Reset` before releasing, even if they have been measured.

Some limitations are inherent to open systems simulation, and may not ever be supported:

- Assertions (e.g.: `AssertMeasurement` and `AssertMeasurementProbability`) are not supported, as these assertions may fail for correct code in the presence of noise. These assertions are no-ops on the experimental simulators.

## Using Preview Simulators from Python

> ### **â“˜** TIP

> See the [example on using the preview simulators from Python](./examples/preview-simulators-from-python.ipynb) for more details.

Once you have the right version of the `qsharp-core` Python package installed, you can enable the use of the experimental simulators by using the `qsharp.experimental` module:

```python
import qsharp
import qsharp.experimental
qsharp.experimental.enable_noisy_simulation()
```

After calling `enable_noisy_simulation()`, Q# operations imported into Python will expose a `.simulate_noise()` method that can be used to run Q# programs against the experimental simulators.

By default, `.simulate_noise()` will assume an ideal error model (that is, no noise). To configure a particular error model, use the `qsharp.experimental.get_noise_model` and `qsharp.experimental.set_noise_model` functions to get and set the current noise model for the preview simulators. Each error model is represented as a dictionary from intrinsic operation names to objects representing the errors in those intrinsic operations.

For open systems simulation, error channels can be represented by [QuTiP](https://qutip.org/) `Qobj` objects encoding superoperators.

```python

```

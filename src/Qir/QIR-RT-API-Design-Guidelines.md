## Summary of This Document

At the moment of writing the [QIR Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/tree/main/src/Qir/Runtime) 
was a set of dynamic libraries exposing the API in the form of both C and C++ entities
(plus IR wrappers around certain C functions).
The C++ part and some other features, according to 
[this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22797418/how-do-i-safely-pass-objects-especially-stl-objects-to-and-from-a-dll/22797419#22797419),
were to cause problems for the users.  

Since the QIR Runtime was going public, we needed to mitigate those problems. These guidelines were among the first steps in that effort,
intended to provide the instructions about what to do and what to avoid when designing the QIR Runtime API or making changes to it.

Those who need just the summary of recommendations (the _result_ of the decision-making process),
can run throuhg the [Guidelines](#guidelines) section.
Those who would like to see the grounds/reasoning behind the decisions made, can see the 
[Considerations Taken Into Account](#considerations-taken-into-account) section.


## Guidelines

### Terms

**ABI** - [Application Binary Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)  
**binary** - A dynamic library or an executable file. 
The interacting binaries can be written in different languages and built with different compilers.  
**cross-ABI interface** - The interface between the binaries. 
This document mostly deals with the interface between the QIR Runtime dynamic library on the one hand, 
and the executable and other dynamic libraries (like simulator) on the other hand.  
**IR** - 
[intermediate representation](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2018/llvm-ir-and-go/#:~:text=LLVM%20IR%20is%20a%20low,number%20of%20function%20local%20registers.&text=Front%2Dend%3A%20compiles%20source%20language,compiles%20IR%20to%20machine%20code.) 
of [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).  
**QIR** - quantum intermediate representation - a subset of the IR. Is generated by the Q# compiler from the Q# code.  
**RT** - Runtime.  

### Know the Issues When Crossing the ABI Boundary
See 
[the post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22797418/how-do-i-safely-pass-objects-especially-stl-objects-to-and-from-a-dll/22797419#22797419)
that resulted in these guidelines.

### Be Aware of Different Compilers for Different Binaries
Take into account that different binaries can be written in different languages, by different people,
built with different compilers or different versions of the compiler, 
with different command line arguments, by different scripts, on different machines.

Bear in mind that QIR RT API needs to be callable from other languages and environments. 
At the moment of writing the particular plan was to call the QIR RT API from the 
[IQ#](https://ms-quantum.visualstudio.com/Quantum%20Program/_wiki/wikis/Quantum-OKRs.wiki/470/IQSharp). 
Next, there was a chance of calling from Python, and possibly Rust.

Avoid using the features that preclude calling the QIR RT API from other languages and environments.


### Expose as Little as Necessary
Every piece of code has a long-term cost associated with it.
The more code we write, the more bugs we can introduce, the more care is needed during migration to the newer compiler
and while porting to a different platform. The higher is the risk of identifier conflict with the other people's code 
and new features of the language. The more identifiers we use, the less freedom remains for a different use of those identifiers.

### Expose C Only
Do not expose the C++ identifiers and features (not present in C) - 
the C++ data types (e.g. `class`), templates, function overloads, namespaces, etc.
To facilitate that for yourself and for the others, consider strictly separating 
the C and C++ code into .h/.c files for C, and .hpp/.cpp. files for C++. Expose C headers only.

If the exposed headers need to include the other headers, then include the C headers only, not the C++ headers. 
In particular, the standard C headers, 
e.g. [`<stdio.h>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io), have the corresponding wrapping headers in C++, 
e.g. [`<cstdio>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c). Such wrapping headers add the namespace prefix 
`std::` to certain C declarations, but not all. The C++'s wrapping headers
may enclose the corresponding C header in the `extern "C"` block (and probably do something else).
This is the right thing for the C++ code internal to a binary, but not what we want in the API exposed by the QIR RT.
So, in the C headers that QIR RT exposes, include C's header `<stdio.h>` (if needed), but not C++'s header `<cstdio>`.

Everything that your C header exposes, needs to be within the 
[`extern "C"`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage) block 
(visible to C++ compiler but not to C compiler, because `extern "C"` is a C++ feature). Example:
```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif

.. // `#include`s
.. // Exposed API.

#ifdef __cplusplus
} // extern "C"
#endif
```
Such that the exposed API will be treated as C code (code having C language linkage), 
regardless of whether this header is included by the C or C++ source file.

### Allocate and Deallocate In The Same Binary
Since different binaries can be built with differnt compilers,
these bianaries can be linked with different C/C++ runtimes, i.e. they can be using different heaps.
The allocation made in a heap must be deallocated in the same heap.
I.e. the allocation and corresponding deallocation must be done by the same binary.
If the binary exposes a function that returns a pointer to the heap-allocated block,
then that binary must also expose a function that deallocates such a pointer. 
Otherwise the heap used for allocation can leak the data,
and the heap used for deallocation can be corrupted.

### Avoid Exposing Entities With Multiple Layouts
Avoid exposing the entities that may have different layouts in different binaries. 
E.g. the alignment padding between the `struct` fields
can be different in the QIR RT dynamic library and the executable that uses the QIR RT. Thus  

_Avoid exposing_ `struct`.

If you need to expose a mechanism that manipulates a `struct` instance, then you can expose  
* a function that allocates the `struct` and returns the `void*` (`void` pointer) to it,  
* a function that deallocates the `struct`, taking the `void*` parameter,  
* functions that manipulate the `struct`, taking the `void*` to the `struct` as the first argument.  

E.g. for the 
[`QirArray`](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/9eb00a0f3f4beb1eee97dccb23e16ad995f5398e/src/Qir/Runtime/public/QirTypes.hpp#L15)

| Instead Of                                                         |     Possible Option |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `QirArray::QirArray(int64_t cQubits)` (constructor)                | `void* QirArray_NewQubits(int64_t qubitCount)` |
| `QirArray::QirArray(const QirArray* other)` (copy constructor)     | `void* QirArray_NewCopy(void* other)` |
| `QirArray::~QirArray()` (destructor)                               | `void QirArray_Delete(void *)` |
| `char* QirArray::GetItemPointer(int64_t index)` (memeber function) | `void* QirArray_GetItemPointer(uint64_t index)` |

Note: In IR the `void*` is not available as a type. You can expose `i8*` instead, and in the calling C/C++ code use `int8_t*`.

If it is still better to expose `struct` then strictly document the `struct` layout and size your code expects. 
You can enforce the layout checks with the 
[compile-time C assertions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/static_assert):
```c
#include <stddef.h>     // offsetof()
#include <assert.h>     // static_assert()

typedef struct
{
    char        c;      // 1-byte field.
                        // 3 bytes of alignment gap.
    uint32_t    u32;    // Is expected at offset 4.
                        // Total size is 8.
}
MyStruct;

static_assert(offsetof(MyStruct, u32) == sizeof(uint32_t), "Unexpected layout of `MyStruct`");
static_assert(sizeof(MyStruct) == (2 * sizeof(uint32_t)), "Unexpected size of `MyStruct`");
```

Note: The 
[`#pragma pack`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3318410/pragma-pack-effect/3318475#3318475) 
is not guaranteed to help your exposed API. The pragma can be silently ignored by the user's compiler.

Note: For providing a direct access to the `struct` fileds 
you may want to expose functions that return the address of a particular field inside of the `struct`:  
```c
uint32_t* MyStruct_GetU32Ptr(void* pStruct);    // Returns the address of `u32` field of a struct 
                                                // pointed to by the parameter.
```

### Be Careful When Exposing Certain Data Types
The size (in bytes) of such data types as `bool`, C's `enum`, `signed` and `unsigned` {`short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`}
is implementation-specific, thus can be different on different sides of the ABI boundary. 
In general prefer the fixed-size alternatives. See the type-specific details below.

#### Integer Types
In the exposed API, for integers, prefer the fixed-size types defined in 
[`<stdint.h>`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdint/?kw=stdint.h), e.g. `uint8_t`, `int32_t`, etc.

Note: Avoid using in the exposed API the _non-fixed-size_ types from that header, 
such as `uint_least8_t`, `uint_fast16_t` (but feel free to use them internally in your binary).

Note: If you use the [printf-family functions](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html) 
for formatted output of the types defined in `<stdint.h>`, 
or [scanf-family functions](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/scanf.3.html) for formatted input,
then use the macros defined in [`<inttypes.h>`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cinttypes/).  
Example: 
```c
#include <stdint.h>     // uint32_t
#include <inttypes.h>   // SCNu32, PRIu32
#include <stdio.h>      // scanf(), printf()

uint32_t u32;           // Fixed-size variable.
scanf(SCNu32, &u32);    // Formatted input.
printf("Value is " PRIu32 "\n", u32);   // Formatted output.
```

#### `char`
The size of types `char`, `unsigned char`, `signed char` is fixed and is equal to 1 byte. 

In the exposed API it is safe to use `char` for characters and C strings (null-terminated sequences of `char`s).

For integers of size 1 prefer `uint8_t` or `int8_t`. If you use `char` for integers, 
then specify explicitly either `unsigned char` or `signed char`, 
because the plain `char` is interpreted differently in different implementations. 
In some implementations `char` defaults to `unsigned char`, in the others - to `signed char`.

#### `enum`
The [C's `enum`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/enum) type is _non-fixed-size_ 
(as opposed to [C++'s `enum`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum) that can have an _underlying type_). 

The code will be safe if you do not use `enum` type in the function signatures (function parameter types or return type).
Exposing `enum` as a stand-alone type (and exposing variables of that type) requires care, 
control over the compatible fixed-size types that are safe to cast the `enum` to. 
So, think twice before exposing `enum`. Document well the ranges of values, safe types to cast to, etc.
Use mechanisms that prevent the erroneous use. 
See details in [The `enum` Type](#the-`enum`-type) section.

If you still plan to expose `enum`:

Note: In C language if you define the `enum` type like this:
```c
enum MyEnumType
{
    ..
};
```
then _in C_ you will have to write `enum MyEnumType`, i.e. 2 words, every time you use the `enum`. 
If you want to use just 1 word - `MyEnumType` - you can define the `enum` type like this:
```c
typedef enum
{
    ..
}
MyEnumType;
```

Note: You can expose the enumerators only (rather that the whole `enum` type). 
But remember, the enumerators in C have the type `int` - _non-fixed-size type_.
```c
enum
{
    ENUMERATOR_A,   // Has type `int`.
    ENUMERATOR_B    // Has type `int`.
};
```
Trick: Chris Granade has shown how Rust's cbindgen exposes enums to C as having a fixed size:
```c
enum Pauli 
{
  I = 0,
  X = 1,
  Y = 3,
  Z = 2,
};
typedef uint8_t Pauli;
```
As long as in the exposed API you type `Pauli` (rather than `enum Pauli`), you use the fixed-size type `uint8_t`.
And the type `enum Pauli` defines the range of values 
and the constants that can be used with `Pauli` type (internally in the binaries).

#### `bool`
The `bool` type is non-fixed-size (both in [C](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/boolean) and 
[C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types#Boolean_type)).
Be careful if using `bool` in the exposed API, prefer a fixed-size integer type instead (e.g. `uint8_t`).

If using fixed-size integer instead of `bool`, strictly document the range of values, 
in particular what value corresponds to the concept of `true` 
(value of `1`, or any non-zero value, or other). 

For your information: [In Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/boolean.html)  
> **An object with the boolean type has a size** and alignment **of 1** each. 
The value false has the bit pattern `0x00` and the value true has the bit pattern `0x01`.

Note: One may want for `bool` to follow the Chris Granade's trick for `enum` mentioned above.  
Example:
```c
// enum Bool : uint8_t { False, True };
typedef uint8_t Bool;
```
As long as in the exposed API you write `Bool` (rather than `bool`), you use the fixed-size type `uint8_t`.
And the comment explains the type `Bool`.

When choosing the range of values, 
and for the safe internal use of Booleans and their substitutes, see also

* [Know the Limitations of `memset()` When Initializing](https://github.com/kuzminrobin/code_review_notes/blob/master/cpp_design_bookmarks.md#know-the-limitations-of-memset-when-initializing)


#### Floating-Point Types

Strictly speaking, the floating-point types (`float`, `double`, `long double`) are non-fixed-size. 
However these guidelines suggest to expect that the following floating-point types conform to the same standards
on both sides of the ABI boundary:  
* `float` matches IEEE-754 _32 bit_ floating point type (IEC 60559 single format),  
* `double` matches IEEE-754 _64 bit_ floating point type (IEC 60559 double format).  

To detect the size discrepancy, you can use the following 
[compile-time C assertions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/static_assert) 
in the exposed C headers (if your exposed API uses a floating-point type):
```c
static_assert(sizeof(float ) == sizeof(uint32_t), "Unexpected size of `float`" );
static_assert(sizeof(double) == sizeof(uint64_t), "Unexpected size of `double`");
```
As for [`long double` type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/arithmetic_types#Real_floating_types), 
the decision has not been made at the time of writing. If you need to expose the mechanisms that use this type,
then you can follow the recomendations in the 
[Avoid Exposing Entities With Multiple Layouts](#avoid-exposing-entities-with-multiple-layouts) section.

The examples of where the floating-point types were used at the moment of writing are  
* [`%String* @__quantum__rt__double_to_string(double %val)`](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/a15856ea9aac6244718865481dbbd89b70056166/src/Qir/Runtime/lib/QIR/bridge-rt.ll#L457),  
* [`QIR_SHARED_API QirString* quantum__rt__double_to_string(double)`](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/4ee33c0a1fb89cc859254175fea74b841a4fd01c/src/Qir/Runtime/public/QirRuntime.hpp#L203),  

a number of math functions, e.g.  
* [`dllexport double @__quantum__qis__sin__body(double %theta)`](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/4ee33c0a1fb89cc859254175fea74b841a4fd01c/src/Qir/Runtime/lib/QSharpFoundation/qsharp-foundation-qis.ll#L121). 


### Don't Let the C++ Exceptions Cross the ABI Boundary
Our cross-ABI interface is a subset of C interface. The C interface does not include the C++ exceptions. The C++ exceptions 
crossing the ABI Boundary are likely to stay uncaught and result in a crash.
If you are still thinking about designing an interface that tunnels the C++ exceptions through our subset of C  
(an interface where the C++ exceptions are thrown on one side and caught on the other side of the ABI boundary), 
then you should know the following.

In some implementations the C++ exception instances are allocated on the heap during `throw`, and then deallocated during `catch`.
If `throw` and `catch` are on different sides of the ABI boundary then they are likely to use different heaps. 
The consequence is described in the 
[Allocate and Deallocate In The Same Binary](#allocate-and-deallocate-in-the-same-binary) section above.

At the moment of writing the 
[Fail-Statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/statements/returnsandtermination#fail-statement) 
implementation
([`quantum__rt__fail_cstr()`](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/b10447eff672b7ba4f2e8564302888a8eb6bce8a/src/Qir/Runtime/lib/QIR/utils.cpp#L60))
was throwing an exception not caught anywhere.
This was causing a reasonably peaceful termination as long as the same compiler was used on both sides of the ABI boundary.
The plan was to replace the exception throw with the [`exit()`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/exit/)
or [`terminate()`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/exception/terminate)
or [`abort()`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/abort) or other alternatives.

On the other hand, exceptions are a natural part of the C++ standard. It is virtually impossible to use
the standard library (STL, `std` namespace) and not to use exceptions. All _exceptional_ situations are
reported by using exceptions (such as [`out_of_range`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/out_of_range) or [`invalid_argument`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/invalid_argument) to name a few). So it is safe to assume
that the C++ code we are developing will throw exceptions even if they aren't thrown right in the code we write.

Recommendation is to use `std` namespace and exceptions in C++ code **only where appropriate**. Many recommendations
exist on how to use exceptions properly and minimize performance penalties.

* [Exceptions and Error Handling](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/exceptions) As part of Modern C++ FAQ.
* Google guidelines recommend against exceptions, but [allow them in Windows code, especially while using STL](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Windows_Code).
* [Vishal Chovatiya Guidelines](http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/7-best-practices-for-exception-handling-in-cpp-with-example/), which may be easier to read.
This section will describe only exceptions with regards to the runtime API.

* Do not handle hardware exceptions and out-of-memory exception

It is not recommended to catch asynchronous harware exceptions. (MSVC compiler calls this
[Structured Exception Handling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=msvc-160).)
Examples of hardware exceptions are the exceptions thrown when accessing a forbidden memory location as a result of a null pointer access, stack overflow, corrupt pointer dereferencing, unaligned memory access, etc.. If such exceptional situation arises, application should fail fast and quit. Typically hardware exceptions are handled in a system level code, and our runtime is an application with
regards to the host OS. NOTE: The [MSVC's default exception handling behavior](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model?view=msvc-160#default-exception-handling-behavior) does not conform to the C++ standard. Use the `/EHsc` flag to [conform to the standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model?view=msvc-160#standard-c-exception-handling).

It is also not recommended to handle out-of-memory exception as there's a very little chance of handling it right.
For such handling to work correctly there shouldn't be any memory allocation from the point of exception, in the stack
unwinding process, till the handling of exception and in the handling of exception until the out-of-memory situation
is resolved. Just let the application fail. For the same reason, using non-throwing version of operator new is not recommended.

* Mark interface functions with `noexcept`

If you implement an interface function mark it with the [noexcept specifier](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec):

Inside of your binary if you implement a function that should not throw exceptions, then mark it with the [noexcept specifier](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec).

> void interface_func() **noexcept**

The `extern "C"` functions aren't considered `noexcept` by default. Consider marking them `noexcept`.
Keep in mind that `noexcept` specifier is a C++ feature. If you need to add `noexcept` specifier
to a public header or any other header that should be compatible with a C compiler
make sure to use `__cplusplus` guards. For example:

```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
#define NOEXCEPT noexcept     // `noexcept` in C++ only.
extern "C"
{
#else
#define NOEXCEPT      // In C this macro is empty.
#endif

.. // `#include`s
void f() NOEXCEPT;    // Exposed function. It is `noexcept` if the header is included to the C++ source file.

#ifdef __cplusplus
} // extern "C"
#endif
```

If exception is thrown (and not caught) within the `noexcept` function, the application will terminate. Termination will
ensure that exceptions will never cross the API boundaries. An overhead is incurred if a noexcept function
calls functions that can throw exceptions, so consider marking all functions that shouldn't throw exceptions as `noexcept`.
If you are calling functions that can throw exceptions, make sure to handle them properly.

* If using the [`dynamic_cast<>()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/dynamic_cast), 
consider casting the _pointers_ rather than _references_, e.g. 
```c++
MyClass myInstance = .. // Create an instance of a class that may or may not implement the `IMyInterface` interface.
IMyInterface & myItfRef = dynamic_cast<IMyInterface &>( myInstance); // Casts the _reference_, in case of failure THROWS! Avoid using this.
IMyInterface * myItfPtr = dynamic_cast<IMyInterface *>(&myInstance); // Casts the _pointer_, in case of failure returns the nullptr. Consider this first.
```
This way you can handle the erroneous situation without raising exceptions.

## Considerations Taken Into Account

### The `bool` Type

In C language `bool` is a macro that expands to the keyword `_Bool` ([details](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/boolean)).

[[C17_N2176](https://web.archive.org/web/20181230041359if_/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_updated_proposed_fdis.pdf)], 
6.2.5 Types, paragraph 2
> An object declared as type `_Bool` **is large enough to store the values 0 and 1**.

I.e. the size of `bool` is _at least 1 bit_, but there is no upper limit. Type `bool` is _non-fixed-size_.

Be careful if using `bool` in the exposed API, prefer a fixed-size integer type instead (e.g. `uint8_t`).  
Illustration:
* Your dynamic library exposes the `bool` global variable - `extern bool MyVar;`.
* In your dynamic library the type `bool` is _1 byte_.
* The user's executable includes your header.
* In the user's executable the type `bool` is _4 bytes_.
* When the user's code updates your variable - `MyVar = true`, the code updates _4 bytes_ (rather than _1_) - 
the byte of your variable and _3 more bytes outside of it_ (thus corrupting the data after `MyVar`).

### The `char` Type

**`sizeof(char)`, `sizeof(unsigned char)`, `sizeof(signed char)`, are 1**  
[[C17_N2176](https://web.archive.org/web/20181230041359if_/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_updated_proposed_fdis.pdf)]:  
6.5.3.4 The `sizeof` and `_Alignof` operators, paragraph 4:  
> When `sizeof` is applied to an operand that has type `char`, `unsigned char`, or `signed char`,
(or a qualified version thereof) the result is 1.

**`char` can default to `signed char` or `unsigned char`**  
6.2.5 Types, paragraph 15:  
> The three types `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` are collectively called the _character types_.
The **implementation shall define** `char` to have the same range,
representation, and behavior as **either `signed char` or `unsigned char`**.45)  
  
> 45\) `CHAR_MIN`, defined in `<limits.h>`, will have one of the values 0 or `SCHAR_MIN`,
and this can be used to distinguish the two options. Irrespective of the choice made, 
**`char` is a separate type from the other two and is not compatible with either**.

So, don't use `char` for integers, use `unsigned char` or `signed char` instead.

### The `enum` Type
[[C17_N2176](https://web.archive.org/web/20181230041359if_/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_updated_proposed_fdis.pdf)]
6.7.2.2 Enumeration specifiers, Paragraph 4
> Each enumerated type shall be compatible with `char`, a signed integer type, or an unsigned integer type. 
**The choice of type is implementation-defined**...

I.e. the [C's `enum`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/enum) type is _non-fixed-size_ 
(as opposed to [C++'s `enum`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum) that can have an _underlying type_). 


**The `enum` in function signatures**  
The code will be safe if you _do not_ use `enum` type in the function signatures (function parameter types or return type).

Illustration:
* Let's say your dynamic library exposes a function having a parameter `e` of the `enum` type, 
and some parameters before and after it:
```c
typedef enum { .. } MyEnumType;
void func(uint16 uia, MyEnumType e, uint16_t uib);
```
* Let's imagine that (according to the [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention)) 
the parameter `e` needs to be passed through the _stack_ (rather than a CPU register).
* Let's say in your dynamic library the `enum` type is 2 bytes in size. So, during the call, 
the 2 bytes need to be allocated on the stack for the parameter `e`.
* Immediately after it, the 2 bytes need to be allocated on the stack for the parameter `uib` 
(or the parameter `uia`, the order of the parameters in the stack depends on the 
[language linkage](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage) and/or 
calling convention).
* The user's executable includes your header and calls your function `func()`.
* But in the user's executable the `MyEnumType` is _4 bytes_ in size. 
So the 4 bytes are allocated on the stack (instead of 2).
* And the value for parameter `uib` is pushed to the stack _after those 4 bytes_, 
to a place where the function `func()` does not expect it.

To summarize, the caller passes `uib` through that part of the stack where the callee `func()` does not expect it,
and where the callee expects it, the 0 is passed.

**The stand-alone `enum`**  
Exposing `enum` as a stand-alone type (and exposing variables of that type) requires care, 
control over the compatible fixed-size types that are safe to cast the `enum` to. 

Illustration:
* You need your dynamic library to expose a function having a parameter of the `enum` type.  
* You expose the `enum` type separately.  
```c
typedef enum
{
    ENUMERATOR_A,
    ENUMERATOR_B
}
MyEnumType;
```
* You expose the function, but, to be safe, you expose the parameter as a fixed-size type `uint8_t`.
```c
void func(uint8_t param);
```

The user's executable uses your dynamic library. The executable's source file (.c) includes your header 
(that exposes the `enum` type and the function). The user's code creates a local varaible of the `enum` type, 
initializes the variable with one of the enumerators (of that `enum` type), 
and passes the variable as an argument to your function. 
The argument (of `enum` type) is implicitly cast to the type of the parameter - `uint8_t`. 

_Is it safe_ to implicitly cast such an `enum` to `unit8_t`? Or, maybe the `enum` type has enumerators with value above `0xFF`,
and that's why the `enum` type is at least 2 bytes in size 
(and upon cast to `uint8_t` only the least significant byte will end up in the parameter)?

Do you rely on the _C_ compiler to warn?
Even if it _does_ warn, the programmers sometimes just carelessly _explicitly_ cast `enum` to `unit8_t`
(without the anlysis of the value range).  

So, think twice before exposing `enum`. Document well the ranges of values, safe types to cast to, etc.
Use mechanisms that prevent the erroneous use, e.g. 
[compile-time C assertions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/static_assert):
```c
static_assert(ENUMERATOR_B <= UINT8_MAX, 
              "`MyEnumType` is incompatible with the parameter of `func()`. "
              "Increase the parameter type");
``` 


### The Floating-Point Types

The explicit specification of the *size* for the floating-point types was not found in one of the late drafts 
of the C17 standard (see [Information Sources](#information-sources)). However the section "F.2 Types" says:  
> — The `float` type matches the IEC 60559 single format.  
— The `double` type matches the IEC 60559 double format.  

Unfortunately in the ISO/IEC 60559, Edition 2.0 2020-05 (and IEEE Std 754™-2019, IEEE Std 754™-2008), the size specification
of "single format" and "double format" was not found.

However the C's [Real floating types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/arithmetic_types#Real_floating_types) 
section of cppreference states:  
> 
* `float` - single precision floating point type. Matches IEEE-754 32 bit floating point type if supported.
* `double` - double precision floating point type. Matches IEEE-754 64 bit floating point type if supported
* `long double` - extended precision floating point type. Matches IEEE-754 extended floating-point type if supported, 
otherwise matches some non-standard extended floating-point type as long as its precision is better than `double` 
and range is at least as good as `double`, otherwise matches the type `double`. 
Some x86 and x86_64 implementations use the 80-bit x87 floating point type.

Also the following was taken into account  
* [Single-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format) 
(Wikipedia)  
* [Double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) 
(Wikipedia)  
* [Fixed-size floating point types](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2524737/fixed-size-floating-point-types) 
(Stackoverflow)  
* [What is the size of float and double in C and C++? [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25524355/what-is-the-size-of-float-and-double-in-c-and-c) 
(Stackoverflow)  


### The Integer Types

(Not strictly related to this document, but is still provided for those who are interested. 
Also answers a number of other questions about the integer types, and supports certain statements in the other sections).

It seemed commonly known that  
`sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long)`  
But looks like C does not guarantee that, as opposed to C++, and the topic is rather arguable.
See details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67678644/6362941).

# The Native QIR Runtime

This folder contains the Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) Runtime project. The QIR is a subset of the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) Intermediate Representation.
The QIR runtime includes an implementation of the
 [QIR specification](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/tree/main/Specifications/QIR) and the bridge to
 run QIR against the native full state simulator.

- `public` folder contains the public headers
- `lib` folder contains the implementation of the runtime and the simulators.
- `unittests` folder contains tests for the runtime
- `Externals` folder contains external dependencies. We'll strive to keep those minimal.

## Build

### Prerequisites

The QirRuntime project is using CMake (3.17) + Ninja(1.10.0) + Clang++(11.0.0). Other versions of the tools might work
 but haven't been tested. Only x64 architecture is supported.  
For running the PowerShell scripts below use 
[PowerShell Core or PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), not the inbox PowerShell.

To install prerequisite tools for building the QIR runtime, you can set the `ENABLE_QIRRUNTIME` environment variable to the string `"true"` 
and run [`prerequisites.ps1`](prerequisites.ps1), or manually install pre-reqs with the steps listed below.
Note that on Windows, this script relies on the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/),
while on macOS, `prerequisites.ps1` relies on the [`brew` package manager](https://brew.sh).

#### Windows pre-reqs

1. Install Clang 11, Ninja and CMake from the public distros.
1. Add all three to your/system `%PATH%`.
1. Install VS 2019 and enable "Desktop development with C++" component (Clang uses MSVC's standard library on Windows).
1. Install clang-tidy and clang-format if your Clang/LLVM packages didn't include the tools.
1. Install the same version of dotnet as specified by qsharp-runtime [README](../../../README.md)

*Building from Visual Studio and VS Code is **not** supported.
Running cmake from the editors will likely default to MSVC or clang-cl and fail.*

#### Linux via WSL pre-reqs

1. On the host Windows machine [enable WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and install
 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
1. In the Ubuntu's terminal:
    1. `$ sudo apt install cmake` (`$ cmake --version` should return 3.16.3)
    1. `$ sudo apt-get install ninja-build` (`$ ninja --version` should return 1.10.0)
    1. `$ sudo apt install clang-11` (`$ clang++-11 --version` should return 11.0.0)
    1. Set Clang as the preferred C/C++ compiler:
        - $ export CC=/usr/bin/clang-11
        - $ export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++-11
    1. `$ sudo apt install clang-tidy-11` (`$ clang-tidy-11 --version` should return 'LLVM version 11.0.0')
    1. Install the same version of dotnet as specified by qsharp-runtime [README](../../../README.md)

See [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl] on how to use VS Code with WSL.

#### Other Prerequisites

The build depends on `Microsoft.Quantum.Simulator.Runtime` dynamic library built at a higher level of the directory tree.
To build that library follow the instructions in [`qsharp-runtime/README.md`](../../../README.md#building-from-source)
(up to and including the step `Simulation.sln`).


### Build Commands

To build QirRuntime you can run [`build-qir-runtime.ps1`](build-qir-runtime.ps1) script from QirRuntime folder:
```batch
pwsh build-qir-runtime.ps1
```
  
The script will create the `build/{Debug|Release}` folder and place the build artifacts in it. The configuration `Debug|Release`
is specified with the `BUILD_CONFIGURATION` environment variable.
If the variable is not set then the default is specified in [`set-env.ps1`](../../../build/set-env.ps1).  

## Tests

The tests in the `unittests` folder are those that are compiled directly against the object libraries
from the runtime, and verify behavior of the runtime using more than the public API. For tests that 
verify behavior of the public API surface using compiled QIR from Q# projects, see the `src/Qir/Tests` folder.

### Running All Tests

```powershell
# Navigate to QirRuntime folder.

pwsh test-qir-runtime.ps1
```

### Running Test Binaries Individually

`<test_binary> -help` provides details on how to run a subset of the tests and other options. For example, you can
 filter tests from the "[skip]" category out by `<test_binary> ~[skip]`.

For tests that depend on the native simulator and qdk shared libraries, you might need to modify the corresponding
 dynamic libraries lookup path environment variable:

- (Windows) PATH
- (Unix) LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- (Darwin) DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

## QIR Bridge and Runtime

This project contains an implementation of the QIR runtime per the
 [QIR specifications](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/tree/main/Specifications/QIR) and the translation
 layer between the QIR and the IR, generated by Clang from the native code. Translation layer is called the "QIR Bridge".

This project also provides an implementation of the quantum instruction set, used by Q# for simulation against the full
state simulator:

```llvm
operation Exp (paulis : Pauli[], theta : Double, qubits : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
void @__quantum__qis__exp__body(%Array*, double, %Array*)
void @__quantum__qis__exp__adj(%Array*, double, %Array*)
void @__quantum__qis__exp__ctl(%Array*, { %Array*, double, %Array* }*)
void @__quantum__qis__exp__ctladj(%Array*, { %Array*, double, %Array* }*)
void @__quantum__qis__h__body(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__h__ctl(%Array*, %Qubit*)
%Result* @__quantum__qis__measure__body(%Array*, %Array*)
void @__quantum__qis__r__body(i2, double, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__r__adj(i2, double, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__r__ctl(%Array*, { i2, double, %Qubit* }*)
void @__quantum__qis__r__ctladj(%Array*, { i2, double, %Qubit* }*)
void @__quantum__qis__s__body(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__s__adj(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__s__ctl(%Array*, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__s__ctladj(%Array*, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__t__body(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__t__adj(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__t__ctl(%Array*, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__t__ctladj(%Array*, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__x__body(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__x__ctl(%Array*, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__y__body(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__y__ctl(%Array*, %Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__z__body(%Qubit*)
void @__quantum__qis__z__ctl(%Array*, %Qubit*)
```

There are two ways to compile and run the QIR files against the runtime.

1. Link against the runtime libraries *statically*. For the example of this approach see `test/QIR-static` tests. It
 allows the client to access the target simulator directly, if so desired.
1. Link against the *shared qdk* library. The example of this approach can be found in `test/QIR-dynamic` folder. In the
 future we'll provide fully self-contained packages of the runtime to enable this workflow completely outside of the
 current project. For now, this way of consuming QIR only supports running against the native full state simulator.

QIR's architecture assumes a single target, whether that be hardware or a particular simulator. As a result, there is no
 provision in the QIR specifications to choose a target dynamically. To connect QIR to the simulators from this runtime,
 we provide `QirExecutionContext::Init()` (earlier `InitializeQirContext`)
 and `QirExecutionContext::Deinit()` (earlier `ReleaseQirContext`) methods.
 Switching contexts while executing QIR isn't supported and would yield undefined behavior.

### Building from IR files

CMake doesn't support using LLVM's IR files as input so instead we invoke Clang directly from custom commands to create
 utility libs that can be linked into other targets using their absolute paths.

*NB*: Compiling from IR has fewer checks than compiling from C++. For example, IR doesn't support overloading so
 declarations and definitions of functions are matched by name, without taking into account the arguments. This means
 that a build might succeed with mismatched signatures between caller/callee which will likely lead to crashes and other
 bugs at runtime.

**The QIR runtime is work in progress. Current known limitations are as follows:**

1. All functionality related to BigInt type (including `__quantum__rt__bigint_to_string`) NYI.
1. QIR is assumed to be __single threaded__. No effort was made to make the bridge and runtime thread safe.
1. Strings are implemented as a thin wrapper over std::string with virtually no optimizations.
1. Variadic functions (e.g. `__quantum__rt__array_create`) require platform specific bridges. The currently implemented
 bridge is for Windows.
1. Qubit borrowing NYI (needs both bridge and simulator's support).

## Coding style and conventions

If during compilation you see an error like this

```
##vso[task.logissue type=error;]Formatting check failed. The following files need to be formatted before compiling:
```

then this means that the edits you made violate the
[coding style](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/main/src/Qir/.clang-format)
enforced by clang-format utility. To format the file install the
Clang-Format extension to your editor ([example for VSCode](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#visual-studio-code-integration)),
open the file, press the corresponding formatting hot keys (for VSCode it is \<Alt+Shift+f\>), and save the file.  
See more links in [.clang-format](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/blob/main/src/Qir/.clang-format) file.

Most of our coding style and conventions are enforced via clang-tidy. The project is currently set up to treat
 clang-tidy warnings as build errors and we'd like to keep it this way. If you absolutely need to violate the style,
 mark the problematic line with `// NOLINT`. To suppress style checks in a whole folder, add .clang-tidy file into the
 folder with checks reduced to `Checks: '-*,bugprone-*'`.

Clang-tidy checks reference: [https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html]

Conventions not covered by .clang-format and .clang-tidy:

- fields of a class/struct must be placed at the top of the class/struct definition;
- must use `this` to access class and struct members: `this->fooBar`;
- Interface declarations should be placed in separate header files with "_I" suffix.: `FooBar_I.hpp`.

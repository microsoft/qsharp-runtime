    /// Given two operations, asserts that they act identically for all input states.
    ///
    /// This assertion is implemented by using the Choi–Jamiłkowski isomorphism to reduce
    /// the assertion to one of a qubit state assertion on two entangled registers.
    /// Thus, this operation needs only a single call to each operation being tested,
    /// but requires twice as many qubits to be allocated.
    /// This assertion can be used to ensure, for instance, that an optimized version of an
    /// operation acts identically to its naïve implementation, or that an operation
    /// which acts on a range of non-quantum inputs agrees with known cases.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// This operation requires that the operation modeling the expected behavior is
    /// adjointable, so that the inverse can be performed on the target register alone.
    /// Formally, one can specify a transpose operation, which relaxes this requirement,
    /// but the transpose operation is not in general physically realizable for arbitrary
    /// quantum operations and thus is not included here as an option.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## nQubits
    /// Number of qubits to pass to each operation.
    /// ## actual
    /// Operation to be tested.
    /// ## expected
    /// Operation defining the expected behavior for the operation under test.

    /// # Summary
    /// Draws a random sample from a categorical distribution specified by a
    /// list of probablities.
    ///
    /// # Description
    /// The probability of selecting a specific index is proportional to the value
    /// of the array element at that index.
    /// Array elements that are equal to zero are ignored and their indices are never
    /// returned. If any array element is less than zero,
    /// or if no array element is greater than zero, then the operation fails.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## probs
    /// An array of floating-point numbers proportional to the probability of
    /// selecting each index.
    ///
    /// # Output
    /// An integer $i$ with probability $\Pr(i) = p_i / \sum_i p_i$, where $p_i$
    /// is the $i$th element of `probs`.
